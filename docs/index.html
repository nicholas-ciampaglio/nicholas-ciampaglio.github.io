    <!-- Replace this text with your own bio -->
    <p>Hello! My name is Nicholas Ciampaglio and I am currently a student at Eastern University working toward two bachelor‚Äôs Degrees
in Computer Science and Data Science.  I am also a part of the Templeton Honors College at the University which is a very prestigious program of Classical Education. I am expected to graduate from this program in May of 2026. I am also pursuing a minor in Business Administration. I really enjoy working on a project and seeing the finished product.</p>

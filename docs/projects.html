    <!-- Replace with your actual projects -->
    <h3>Machine Learning GUI</h3>
    <p>I created a machine learning model using SkLearn to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes. 
        I then used the python library Tkinter to create a GUI that implements the model so the user can input their own data 
        and get a prediction from the model on whether or not they have diabetes and the percentage chance they have it.</p>

    <h3>Pokemon Database</h3>
    <p> I created a pokemon database using PostgreSQL. 
        First I made an ER diagram and relational schema and then used PGAdmin to write the queries and make the database. 
        All the information is included in the write up that can be found on my Github.</p>
  
    <h3>Laptop Dataset</h3>
    <p> In this project I am mainly trying to find relationships between the
        computer parts and the star ratings that those laptops received from Laptop data that was taken in March
        of 2022.</p>
    
    <h3>NBA Dataset Analysis</h3>
    <p> I analyzed a dataset of all NBA players from 1996-2021 using Python and looked at the statistics 
        of some individual players and made different graphs to visualize the analysis.</p>
